# Maven Plugin

Audit a project dependencies using [Sonatype OSS Index](https://ossindex.sonatype.org).

## Via POM execution

Add an invocation of the `ossindex-maven-plugin` via POM execution, adjust poms to include:

    <build>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.sonatype.ossindex.maven</groupId>
          <artifactId>ossindex-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${project.version}<version>
        </plugin>
      <plugins>
    </build>

## Via CLI

If you can not change the POM, you can run the `ossindex:audit` goal directly on the command-line with a project:

    mvn org.sonatype.ossindex.maven:ossindex-maven-plugin:${project.version}:audit
